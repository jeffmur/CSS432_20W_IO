# Multiplayer Checkers
Authors: Jeffrey Murray Jr, Chris Oâ€™Keefe, Sam Krogh

## Project Description
Multiplayer Checkers is an an online, application-based version of American checkers. Players will use a client to connect to a matchmaking server in order to be paired up with other, with the gameplay clients communicating over the server. Players are identified in the game by a username of their choice.

In addition to being able to play a best-of-1 game of checkers against an online opponent (As per the rules here), the application will allow players to rematch their current opponent and track their overall total wins and losses. In-game, players will be able to view the name of their opponent, the current state of the board, as well as whose turn it currently is.

The project itself is currently planned to be developed in C# using Unity and Visual Studio, as our group has experience working with both and Unity will make the GUI and menu design somewhat easier.
